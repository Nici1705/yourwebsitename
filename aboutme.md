    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        I graduated at the top of my class in the MSc in Economic History at the University of Oxford and completed the MSc in Computational Statistics and Machine Learning with Distinction at University College London (UCL). I completed two separate bachelor’s degrees at the University of Tübingen, where I ranked third in my cohort in the BSc Economics and graduated among the Top 10% in the BSc Cognitive Science. I am also very grateful for the opportunity to have studied at the National University of Singapore, Asia’s best university.

        I am currently looking for Research Assistantships and PhD opportunities at the intersection of Economic History and Machine Learning.
