    <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Economic History + Machine Learning</h3>
    <p>I am applying large language models to investigate historical text documents. This allows me to detect new patterns that were previously not found with traditional methods in economic history. I am currently working to publish my master's dissertation with Professor <a href="https://www.sheilaghogilvie.com">Sheilagh Ogilvie</a>.</p>

    <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Machine Learning</h3>
    <p>I plan to delve deeper into training feature point descriptors with deep learning, which I investigated in my bachelor's thesis in the BSc Cognitive Science. I am currently working to publish my bachelor's thesis with Holger Heidrich, a PhD candidate at the chair of Visual Computing at the University of TÃ¼bingen. </p>
